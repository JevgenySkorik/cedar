# edim

edim is a text editor inspired by the oldest text editor ***ed***. The aim of this project is to recreate the ed editor with some improvements, hence the name edim(ed improved). Currently only the basic functionality of the editor is recreated. This project is made for fun, I honestly doubt I will be able to bring major improvements to this editor(surprisingly it has some pretty advanced features).
